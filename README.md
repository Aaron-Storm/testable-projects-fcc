testable projects for freecodecamp.com curriculum expansion.

### Bundle CDNs:
- FOR PRODUCTION: https://gitcdn.link/repo/no-stack-dub-sack/testable-projects-fcc/master/build/bundle.js
  - will not throttle our traffic
  - can take 2hrs or more to propagate changes to all users
- FOR DEV: https://rawgit.com/no-stack-dub-sack/testable-projects-fcc/master/build/bundle.js
  - will throttle heavy traffic
  - changes will propagate much quicker so replace the gitCDN link with this for testing
