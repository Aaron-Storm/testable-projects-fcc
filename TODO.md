# TODO:

- [ ] Create global, re-usable tests for D3 projects
- [ ] Add "click anywhere to close" utility funciton for the "pick test suite" menu
- [ ] Add html copy for each project (explanation, links, user stories) 
    - NOTE: work on this has begun in the recently added `project_copy` directory
- [ ] Replace all CDNs in example projects with production CDN (currently using dev link)
- [ ] Calculator suite errors, write them - they don't seem to be present?
- [ ] Spaces after error messages
- [ ] User story punctuation - remove periods, looks better without them
