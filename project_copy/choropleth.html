<h1>Visualize Data with a Choropleth</h1>
<h2>Intro:</h2>
<p>For this project, we will be utilizing D3 to make a Choropleth Map:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map">
	A <strong>choropleth</strong> map (from Greek χῶρος ("area/region") + πλῆθος ("multitude")) is a thematic map in which areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to the measurement of the statistical variable being displayed on the map, such as population density or per-capita income.
</blockquote>
<p>We will be using the following datasets for this project:</p>
<ul>
	<li>...need link</li>
	<li>...need link</li>
</ul>
<h2>The rules:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		Following the user stories below, and using the data sets we have linked to above, create a data visualization using D3 that is similar to this example: http://codepen.io/Christian-Paul/full/XpbzEv.
	</li>
	<li>
		Pass every test! Each user story has a corresponding automated test. To access this test suite, you can build your project in a fork of this CodePen pen: http://codepen.io/FCC_test_suites/pen/JbgXab, or, if you are developing your project elsewhere, you can pull in the test suite from this CDN in a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag: https://gitcdn.link/repo/no-stack-dub-sack/testable-projects-fcc/master/build/bundle.js. Click the menu icon in the top left corner of the page to pick the correct test suite.
	</li>
	<li>Do not look at the example project's code, recreate the project from scratch and give it your own personal style.</li>
	<li>Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.</li>
	<li>When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your project.</li>
	<li>You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your fellow campers on the <a target="_blank" href="https://forum.freecodecamp.com/c/project-feedback">forum</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck and happy coding!</p>
<h2>User Stories:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>My Choropleth should have a title with a corresponding <code>id="title"</code>.</li>
	<li>My Choropleth should have a description with a corresponding <code>id="description"</code>.</li>
	<li>My Choropleth should have counties with a corresponding <code>class="county"</code> that represent the data.</li>
	<li>There should be at least 4 different fill colors used for the counties.</li>
	<li>My counties should each have <code>"data-fips"</code> and <code>"data-education"</code> properties containing their corresponding fips and education values.</li>
	<li>My Choropleth should have a county for each provided data point.</li>
	<li>The counties should have <code>data-fips</code> and <code>data-education</code> values that match the sample data.</li>
	<li>My Choropleth should have a legend with a corresponding <code>id="legend"</code>.</li>
	<li>There should be at least 4 different fill colors used for the legend.</li>
	<li>When I mouse over a county, a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element with corresponding <code>id="tooltip"</code> should become visible.</li>
	<li>My tooltip should have a <code>"data-education"</code> property that corresponds to the given education of the active county.</li>
